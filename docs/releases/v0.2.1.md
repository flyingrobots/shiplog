# Shiplog v0.2.1 – The Practice Tack

Trim the sails without leaving the dock. This maintenance release adds a safe way to rehearse Shiplog runs while keeping the journal untouched.

## ⚓ Highlight

### 🧪 Dry-Run Preview — `git shiplog run --dry-run`
Plan a maintenance step or incident response without firing the actual command. The new `--dry-run` flag formats the invocation, shows what would be recorded, and exits 0 without executing or writing to the journal.

```bash
$ git shiplog run \
    --dry-run \
    --service deploy \
    --reason "Canary toggle" \
    -- env ./scripts/flip-canary staging
ℹ️ shiplog run --dry-run: would execute: env ./scripts/flip-canary staging
```

- No command side effects and no Git notes are created.
- Bosun-enabled terminals receive a styled “Dry Run” card; otherwise the CLI prints the same message once.
- The exit code is always 0, keeping rehearsals script-friendly.

## 🧭 Upgrade Notes

- No trailer changes or schema updates—existing automation keeps working.
- New dry-run behavior is documented in `docs/features/run.md` and the command reference so teams can adopt it immediately.
- Tests covering both the preview path and the standard execution flow run in the Dockerized Bats matrix.

Hoist v0.2.1 when you want confidence before the real maneuver—Shiplog now lets you practice the tack before committing it to the log.
