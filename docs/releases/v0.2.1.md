# 🚢🪵 Shiplog `v0.2.1` – Dry Run

> 🫲 ***ALL HANDS ON DECK!*** 🫱

> [!information]
> In my haste to release `v0.2.0`, I neglected to add a `--dry-run` mode to `git shiplog run`. This rapid follow-up is to address this oversight.
 
This maintenance release adds a safe way to rehearse Shiplog runs while keeping the journal untouched.

## ⚓ Highlight

### 🧪 Dry-Run Preview — `git shiplog run --dry-run`

Plan a maintenance step or incident response without firing the actual command. The new `--dry-run` flag formats the invocation, shows what would be recorded, and exits 0 without executing or writing to the journal.

```bash
$ git shiplog run \
    --dry-run \
    --service deploy \
    --reason "Canary toggle" \
    -- env ./scripts/flip-canary staging
ℹ️ shiplog run --dry-run: would execute: env ./scripts/flip-canary staging
```

- No command side effects and no Git notes are created.
- Bosun-enabled terminals receive a styled “Dry Run” card; otherwise the CLI prints the same message once.
- The exit code is always 0, keeping rehearsals script-friendly.

## 🧭 Upgrade Notes

- No trailer changes or schema updates
- Existing automation keeps working.
- New dry-run behavior is documented in `docs/features/run.md` and the command reference so teams can adopt it immediately.
- Tests covering both the preview path and the standard execution flow run in the Dockerized Bats matrix.

## 🚦Please, Enjoy
