# Shiplog v0.2.0 – The Cut of Your Jib

Raise the colors and man the rigging—this release outfits Shiplog with fresh gear for wrapping commands, steering automation, and reading the trust roster without leaving the quarterdeck.

## 🏴‍☠️ Highlights

### 🪵 Command Wrapper — `git shiplog run`
Wrap any command, capture stdout/stderr, and record structured run metadata directly in your journal. Shiplog even attaches the command output as a Git note when there is something to read back later.

```bash
$ git shiplog run \
    --service deploy \
    --reason "Smoke test" \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --cluster prod-a \
    --namespace frontend \
    -- env printf hi
hi
Deploy: deploy <none> → prod/us-west-2/prod-a/frontend
Reason: Smoke test
Status: SUCCESS (0s) @ 2025-09-30T02:14:18Z
Seq:    7 (parent 1f6d81d, trust 217be22, anchor (none))
```

The trailer now contains a `run` object describing the invocation:

```bash
$ git shiplog show --json | jq '.run'
{
  "argv": ["env", "printf", "hi"],
  "cmd": "env printf hi",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "status": "success",
  "duration_s": 0,
  "started_at": "2025-09-30T02:14:18Z",
  "finished_at": "2025-09-30T02:14:18Z",
  "log_attached": true
}
```

### 🤖 Automation-Friendly Append — `git shiplog append`
Post entries non-interactively via JSON payloads—no prompts, no environment juggling. Pipe structured data from stdin or point to a file and Shiplog merges it into the trailer.

```bash
$ printf '{"checks":{"canary":"green"}}' \
    | git shiplog append \
        --env prod \
        --service deploy \
        --status success \
        --reason "Post-release smoke" \
        --json -
Deploy: deploy <none> → prod/?/?/prod
Reason: Post-release smoke
Status: SUCCESS (0s) @ 2025-09-30T02:18:50Z
```

```bash
$ git shiplog show --json | jq '{status, why, checks}'
{
  "status": "success",
  "why": {
    "reason": "Post-release smoke",
    "ticket": null
  },
  "checks": {
    "canary": "green"
  }
}
```

### 🤝 Trust Roster View — `git shiplog trust show`
Inspect the current trust contract and signer inventory straight from the CLI. Use `--json` for raw consumption or enjoy a bosun-approved table.

```bash
$ git shiplog trust show
Trust ID: shiplog-trust-root
Threshold: 1
Allowed signers: 1
Maintainers:
  - Shiplog Tester <shiplog-tester@example.com> [root]
Signers:
  - shiplog-tester@example.com (ssh-ed25519)
```

```bash
$ git shiplog trust show --json | jq '{id, threshold, maintainers}'
{
  "id": "shiplog-trust-root",
  "threshold": 1,
  "maintainers": [
    {
      "name": "Shiplog Tester",
      "email": "shiplog-tester@example.com",
      "role": "root",
      "revoked": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### 📋 Structured Entry Schema — `docs/reference/json-schema.md`
We’ve published the JSON Schema for Shiplog trailers (including the new `run` payload). No more guessing field names or status enums—downstream tooling can validate entries with confidence.

## ⚓ Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes; existing journals remain seaworthy.
- `git shiplog run` and `git shiplog append` now populate `SHIPLOG_EXTRA_JSON` internally. Hook authors should merge additional data rather than overwriting the trailer.
- Namespace defaults to the journal name when `SHIPLOG_NAMESPACE` is unset (writing to "staging" now records `namespace="staging"`).
