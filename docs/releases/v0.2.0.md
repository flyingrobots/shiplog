# Shiplog v0.2.0

Release date: 2025-09-30

## Highlights

- **Command wrapper** – `git shiplog run` executes commands, captures stdout/stderr, and records structured `run` metadata while attaching logs automatically when present.
- **Non-interactive append** – `git shiplog append` lets automation post entries by piping JSON (`--json` or `--json-file`) without prompts. Empty namespace values now default to the journal environment for friendlier listings.
- **Trust roster view** – `git shiplog trust show` surfaces trust ID, threshold, maintainers, and resolved signer principals (with `--json` for raw output).
- **Structured payload docs** – Added [structured entry schema](../reference/json-schema.md) for consumers and integrations.

## Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes. Existing journals remain compatible.
- `git shiplog run` sets `SHIPLOG_EXTRA_JSON` internally; downstream hooks should preserve merged JSON when extending the trailer.

## Thanks

Thanks to @reflection and @coderabbit for the detailed review queues that helped tighten the run/append implementation and documentation, and to the QA folks exercising the Docker bats matrix.
