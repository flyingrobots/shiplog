# Daily Log – 2025-09-22 (Archived)

- Rebased branch onto latest `main`; verified new commits (`3390bda`, `9e115b2`) keep trust/policy flow stable inside Docker.
- Hardened developer tooling: guarded `test.sh` against host execution, standardized Docker compose/Makefile resource names, and fixed jq trailer parsing so Bats passes.
- Converted `.devcontainer/scripts/verified-download.sh` to pure Bash to drop the extra interpreter dependency.
- Ran `make test` in Docker (pass) and noted `ci-matrix/run-all.sh` still needs an arm64-friendly Arch base image.
- Updated this worklog (86% complete) and marked “Enforce trust workflow in hooks and tests” plus “Finish sandboxed test migration and isolation” as done.
