Of course. My apologies for the oversight on the cryptographic signing.

Here is a checklist of actionable tasks extracted from the feedback you provided.

### ðŸ“‹ Shiplog Development Checklist

---

- [ ] **Normalize JSON Flags Across All Commands**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Ensure consistent JSON output options (`--json`, `--json-compact`, `--jsonl`) for all commands that return records to improve predictability.
>
> > "Ensure `--json`, `--json-compact`, `--jsonl` exist (or consciously donâ€™t) on every command that returns records (e.g., extend to `verify`, `ls`)." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Add `--json` output to `shiplog verify`.
>   - **Schema:** `{ "env": "prod", "summary": {"ok":N,"badSig":N,"unauthorized":N}, "entries":[{"commit":"â€¦","status":"ok|badSig|unauthorized","reason":"â€¦"}] }`
> - [ ] Add `--json` output to `shiplog validate-trailer`.
>   - **Schema:** Should produce structured errors like `{ "field": "...", "expected": "...", "got": "..." }`.
> - [ ] Review `ls` and other commands to ensure they support the standard set of JSON flags.

---

- [ ] **Implement Tri-State `--push` Flag**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Replace boolean push flags (`--push`/`--no-push`) with a more explicit tri-state option to reduce ambiguity.
>
> > "Replace `--no-push`/`--push` booleans with a triâ€‘state flag. Why: Makes intent explicit; less precedence confusion." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Implement a global `--push=auto|always|never` flag.
> - [ ] Update all commands that perform pushes to respect the new flag's logic.
> - [ ] Ensure the existing precedence rules (flag > git config > env) are documented as the fallback.

---

- [ ] **Enhance `shiplog show` with Note Filtering**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Add native log filtering to `shiplog show` to speed up incident forensics.
>
> > "90% of incident forensics is 'gimme the last 200 lines matching X'." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Implement `shiplog show --tail <N>` to show the last N lines of the attached note.
> - [ ] Implement `shiplog show --grep <PATTERN>` to filter the note content.
> - [ ] Ensure both flags can be used together (e.g., `show --tail 200 --grep ERROR`).

---

- [ ] **Implement Secret Redaction in `shiplog run`**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Make logs safer to share by default by masking secrets in captured output.
>
> > "Mask values in captured logs; default patterns (tokens, passwords)." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Add a `--redact <key=VAL>` flag for simple key-value redaction.
> - [ ] Add a `--redact-env <VAR[,VAR...]>` flag to redact environment variables.
> - [ ] Support regex-based redaction, e.g., `--redact 'token=([A-Za-z0-9._-]+)'`.
> - [ ] When redaction is used, add metadata to the trailer's run block: `"redacted": true, "redact_rules": ["env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "regex:token=â€¦"]`.

---

- [ ] **Create a `shiplog doctor` Command**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Provide a single command to diagnose the Shiplog environment and configuration.
>
> > "Oneâ€‘shot 'why is Shiplog sad?' Checks required tools (git, jq, perl for Bosun), signing config, policy refs present." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Check for the existence and version of dependencies (`git`, `jq`, `perl`).
> - [ ] Verify that signing configuration is valid.
> - [ ] Check that policy refs exist and are reachable.

---

- [ ] **Implement Git Tag and Shiplog Entry Binding**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Create a direct, navigable link between a software release (Git tag) and its deployment record (Shiplog entry).
>
> > "Payoff: 'Show me the deploy for this release' becomes trivial." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Create command `git shiplog tag-link <tag_name> <entry_id>`.
> - [ ] This command should add a `shiplog-id:<OID>` trailer to the annotated tag's message.
> - [ ] It should also create a symbolic link ref: `refs/_shiplog/anchors/tags/<tag_name> -> <entry_id>`.
> - [ ] Implement `git shiplog show --tag <tag_name>` to resolve and display the linked entry.

---

- [ ] **Implement New DX Commands: `diff`, `replay`, `grep`, `open`, `bundle`**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Add a suite of power-user commands for deeper analysis, operational ease, and incident response.
>
> - [ ] **`shiplog diff <entryA> <entryB>`:** Compare trailers, exit codes, durations, and log deltas. Can be built on top of `show --json`.
> - [ ] **`shiplog replay <id>`:** Re-run the command from a previous entry with safety guards (`--confirm`, `--dry-run-first`).
> - [ ] **`shiplog grep '<pattern>'`:** Search across log notes with filters for environment and time (`--env prod --since 7d`). Can wrap `export-json | jq`.
> - [ ] **`shiplog open <id>`:** Use Git remote configuration to generate and open a URL to the entry on the Git host (e.g., GitHub).
> - [ ] **`shiplog bundle <id>`:** Export an "incident pack" (`.tgz`) containing the trailer, note, and trust summary for auditing.

---

- [ ] **Uplift Documentation and README**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Improve the onboarding experience and clarity of the project documentation.
>
> - [ ] Create a "golden path" document that walks a user through a complete `init` â†’ `config` â†’ `run` â†’ `show` â†’ `verify` flow.
> - [ ] Update the README with a punchy hero block: "Shiplog turns deploys into Logs of Provenanceâ„¢..."
> - [ ] Add a "Top 6 quick paths" section to the README for common commands.
> - [ ] Add a sidebar explaining how to use signed mode with SaaS (branch rules) vs. self-hosted (server hooks).

---

- [ ] **Adopt Stricter Bash Best Practices**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Harden the entire script against common shell scripting pitfalls.
>
> - [ ] Apply `set -Eeuo pipefail` and reliable `trap`s in all scripts.
> - [ ] Use `mktemp` for temporary files and ensure they are cleaned up on exit.
> - [ ] Quote all variable expansions (`"$var"`) and use arrays for argument lists.
> - [ ] Prevent recursive Git hooks by using `--no-verify` or a `SHIPLOG_MODE=1` environment variable in internal Git calls.
> - [ ] Add a `shellcheck` job to the CI pipeline and fail the build on new issues.

---

- [ ] **Refactor Bosun to be a JSON-First Renderer**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Decouple the UI presentation (Bosun) from the core logic by making it a pure renderer that operates on a JSON model.
>
> > "Keep Bosun. But make it a renderer, not a feature... Every screen Bosun draws should come from a single JSON blob." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] **Centralize Renderer Choice:** Create a single function `choose_renderer()` that decides between `plain`, `bosun`, or `gum` based on TTY, `--boring`, `SHIPLOG_RENDERER`, and tool availability.
> - [ ] **JSON-First Models:** Modify commands like `ls`, `show`, and `run` to first generate a complete JSON representation of their output.
> - [ ] **Create Renderer Boundary:** The command logic should pass the generated JSON to a renderer function (`bosun_render_show "$json"` or `plain_render_show "$json"`) instead of printing output directly.
> - [ ] **Add Parity Tests:** Create CI tests that run commands in both boring and Bosun mode, asserting that the core information presented is identical.

---

- [ ] **Implement Optional `--dramatic` UI Flair**

> [!note]- **Implementation Details**
> **Goal:** Add a memorable, opt-in UI enhancement for interactive runs without affecting core logic.
>
> > "We keep Shiplog deadâ€‘serious by default, but give humans a dramatic, memorable signal when they want itâ€”without touching the ledger, exit codes, or policy flow." â€” ChatGPT
>
> - [ ] Create a `shiplog_thunder_fx` shell function for printing the banner.
> - [ ] Add a `--dramatic` flag and `SHIPLOG_DRAMA=1` environment variable to trigger it.
> - [ ] Ensure the effect is disabled in `--boring` mode or non-TTY environments.
> - [ ] Add a small section to the README explaining the feature.
