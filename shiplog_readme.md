# üö¢ü™µ Shiplog ‚Äî Git‚ÄëNative Deployment Ledger

Your deployment history belongs next to your code. Shiplog turns deployments, rollbacks, hotfixes, and ops events into immutable Git records ‚Äî human‚Äëreadable for people, structured for machines.

‚Äî

## Highlights

- Git all the way down: no new databases, no SaaS; data lives under refs in your repo.
- Human + JSON: clean TTY views and script‚Äëfriendly output (`--json`, `--json-compact`, `--jsonl`).
- Policy as code: allowlists, per‚Äëenv requirements, and signature rules stored in Git.
- Multi‚Äësig trust: choose chain (commit signatures) or attestation (SSH `-Y verify`) quorum.
- Opt‚Äëin publish: write locally, publish when you decide; avoids noisy hooks mid‚Äëdeploy.

‚Äî

## Quick Start

Install once on your workstation or CI runner:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flyingrobots/shiplog.git "$HOME/.shiplog"
export SHIPLOG_HOME="$HOME/.shiplog" && export PATH="$SHIPLOG_HOME/bin:$PATH"
"$SHIPLOG_HOME/install-shiplog-deps.sh"
git shiplog --version
```

Initialize in your repo and record the first entry:

```bash
cd your-repo
git shiplog init
export SHIPLOG_ENV=prod SHIPLOG_SERVICE=web
git shiplog write    # prompts for metadata; enforces policy/allowlists

# Publish explicitly when ready (journals + notes)
git shiplog publish --env prod
```

### Requirements

Shiplog leans on the standard Git toolchain. Verify these are available first:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| git  | 2.35+ | Recent Git releases handle the refspecs and fast-forward checks Shiplog performs. |
| bash | 5.0+ | Helper scripts run under bash with `set -euo pipefail`, arrays, and `mapfile`. |
| jq   | 1.7+ | Policy validation, JSON exports, and the CLI‚Äôs structured output require jq ‚Äì run `install-shiplog-deps.sh` to install it. |
| ssh-keygen | OpenSSH 8.2+ (for `ssh-keygen -Y verify`) | Needed when using attestation trust mode or verifying SSH signatures. |

`scripts/install-shiplog.sh` clones Shiplog under `$SHIPLOG_HOME` and invokes `install-shiplog-deps.sh`, which provisions jq. Match or exceed these versions on CI runners (see Dockerfile matrix) to avoid surprises.

Prefer a plan first? Use the config wizard:

```bash
git shiplog config --interactive        # Prints a plan; add --apply to write policy/config
git shiplog config --interactive --emit-github-ruleset    # Prints example GitHub Rulesets
git shiplog config --interactive --emit-github-workflow   # Prints a CI verify workflow
```

Browse history (human + JSON):

```bash
git shiplog ls --env prod
git shiplog show --json-compact     # single entry, compact JSON
git shiplog export-json             # NDJSON stream for dashboards
```

Wrap and capture a run:

```bash
git shiplog run --service deploy --reason "canary" -- \
  kubectl rollout status deploy/web
# Prints a minimal confirmation (default "ü™µ"); set SHIPLOG_CONFIRM_TEXT to override
```

Non‚Äëinteractive/CI tip: pass required fields via flags or env to avoid prompts.

```bash
SHIPLOG_ENV=prod SHIPLOG_SERVICE=web \
  git shiplog --boring --yes write --status success --reason "first run"

printf '{"checks":{"smoke":"green"}}' | \
  git shiplog append --service web --status success --json -
```

## How It Works

- Refs (where data lives)
  - Journals: `refs/_shiplog/journal/<env>` (append‚Äëonly, fast‚Äëforward)
  - Policy:   `refs/_shiplog/policy/current`
  - Trust:    `refs/_shiplog/trust/root`
- Policy resolution: merges CLI/env overrides, repo config, policy ref, and working fallback. See docs/features/policy.md.
- Notes: attachments (e.g., logs) under `refs/_shiplog/notes/logs` are associated with entries.

## Multi‚ÄëSig Trust Modes

Choose how maintainer approval is expressed. Both are supported; pick what fits your workflow.

- Chain (sig_mode=chain)
  - Maintainers co‚Äësign trust commits; threshold distinct signers over the same trust tree.
  - Pros: fully Git‚Äënative, great audit trail.
  - Cons: maintainers sign trust commits (often via a maintainer workflow).

- Attestation (sig_mode=attestation)
  - Maintainers sign a canonical payload (tree OID + context); verified via `ssh-keygen -Y verify`.
  - Pros: flexible; easy to automate with SSH keys.
  - Cons: additional artifact handling; precise canonicalization matters.

Fast pick: chain if maintainers can sign commits; attestation when signatures come from automation/SSH. See docs/TRUST.md for bootstrapping and verifier details.

‚Äî

## Git Hosts & Enforcement

- GitHub.com (SaaS): no custom server hooks. Protect Shiplog refs with Branch/Push Rulesets and Required Status Checks. For SaaS, prefer a branch namespace (`refs/heads/_shiplog/**`) so rules apply. See docs/hosting/github.md.
- Self‚Äëhosted (GH Enterprise, GitLab self‚Äëmanaged, Gitea, Bitbucket DC): install the pre‚Äëreceive hook (`contrib/hooks/pre-receive.shiplog`) to enforce policy/trust server‚Äëside.
- Matrix & recipes: docs/hosting/matrix.md summarizes capabilities and recommended configs.

Switching namespaces (custom refs ‚Üî branch namespace) is supported via scripts/shiplog-migrate-ref-root.sh and `git config shiplog.refRoot`.

‚Äî

## Publish vs Auto‚Äëpush

To avoid tripping hooks mid‚Äëdeploy, Shiplog separates writing from publishing.

- Precedence: command flags > `git config shiplog.autoPush` > environment/default.
- Publish explicitly when ready:

```bash
git shiplog publish [--env <env>|--all] [--no-notes] [--policy] [--trust]
```

Examples:
- Disable auto‚Äëpush per repo: `git config shiplog.autoPush false` then publish at the end of a deploy: `git shiplog publish --env prod`.
- Force a one‚Äëoff publish: `git shiplog write --push` (overrides config).

‚Äî

## What‚Äôs Live vs Roadmap

Live now
- Journals (append‚Äëonly by env) with human + JSON views.
- Policy/trust refs; allowlists by env; threshold verification.
- Two trust modes (chain, attestation) + shared verifier script.
- Commands: `run`, `write`, `append`, `ls`, `show`, `export-json`, `publish`.
- Hosting docs: GitHub SaaS guidance and self‚Äëhosted hooks; enforcement matrix.
- Dockerized cross‚Äëdistro tests; CI lint (shell/markdown/yaml); policy validate (CLI + CI schema).

Roadmap (short‚Äëterm)
- Setup Questionnaire improvements and emitters (Rulesets + CI snippets per host).
- Attestation E2E fixtures across distros.
- Flip CI linters to blocking after baseline cleanup.

## Upgrading

See RELEASE_NOTES.md for version‚Äëspecific guidance (e.g., namespace changes, publish defaults, or trust signature gates like `SHIPLOG_REQUIRE_SIGNED_TRUST`).

### Upgrading attestation signatures (legacy ‚Üí canonical)

Older experimental builds used a ‚Äúfull tree‚Äù attestation payload that included the commit‚Äôs tree OID, which created a circular dependency when signatures were stored under `.shiplog/trust_sigs/`. Shiplog now uses a canonical ‚Äúbase tree‚Äù payload (default) that excludes the `trust_sigs` directory:

```
shiplog-trust-tree-v1
<base_tree_oid_of(trust.json + allowed_signers)>
<trust_id>
<threshold>
```

Compatibility:
- The hook/verifier accept both modes. Set `SHIPLOG_ATTEST_BACKCOMP=1` to allow legacy signatures during a transition.
- To prefer a specific mode: `SHIPLOG_ATTEST_PAYLOAD_MODE=base|full` (default `base`).
- We recommend re‚Äësigning with the base payload going forward. See TRUST.md for the exact `ssh-keygen -Y sign`/`-Y verify` commands.

## Contributing & Tests

- Please read AGENTS.md before running tests or editing hooks/scripts.
- Run tests inside Docker: `make test` (optionally: `TEST_TIMEOUT_SECS=180 make test`). Do not run Bats directly on your host.

## FAQ

- What is AJV and why does CI mention it?
  - AJV is a fast JSON Schema validator for Node.js. CI uses it to validate `.shiplog/policy.json` against `examples/policy.schema.json`. Locally, `git shiplog policy validate` performs jq‚Äëbased checks without Node.

- Can Shiplog enforce policy on GitHub.com (SaaS)?
  - SaaS doesn‚Äôt run custom server hooks; use Branch/Push Rulesets + Required Checks and a branch namespace so rules apply to Shiplog refs. See docs/hosting/github.md and docs/hosting/matrix.md.

- Should I use chain or attestation for multi‚Äësig?
  - Chain if maintainers can sign commits; attestation if signatures come from automation/SSH. Both are supported.

## FAQ

- What is AJV and why does CI mention it?
  - AJV is a fast JSON Schema validator for Node.js. We use it in CI to validate `.shiplog/policy.json` (and examples) against `examples/policy.schema.json` so malformed policies are caught early. Locally, `git shiplog policy validate` performs jq‚Äëbased structural checks without requiring Node.

- Can Shiplog enforce policy on GitHub.com (SaaS)?
  - GitHub SaaS does not run custom server hooks. Use Branch/Push Rulesets and Required Status Checks to protect a branch namespace (e.g., `refs/heads/_shiplog/**`) and run verification in CI. For self‚Äëhosted Git, install the pre‚Äëreceive hook for server‚Äëside enforcement. See `docs/hosting/matrix.md` and `docs/hosting/github.md`.

- Should I use chain or attestation for multi‚Äësig?
  - Chain uses signed Git commits; attestation uses `ssh-keygen -Y verify` over a canonical payload. Chain is simplest when maintainers can sign commits; attestation is great when signatures are produced by automation using SSH keys. Both are supported; pick during setup and document in TRUST.md.
